## What is this?

**Obsidian Brain OS** is a complete, battle-tested framework for building an AI-augmented personal knowledge system. Not just a template — it's a running platform:

- 📚 **Three-layer knowledge architecture** (Reading / Working / System)
- 🤖 **Nightly AI pipeline** (article integration → conversation mining → knowledge amplification → daily digest)
- 📋 **Personal ops system** (daily dashboard, weekly planning, commitment tracking, morning brief)
- 🛠️ **Automation scripts** (knowledge lint, nightly digest init, conversation export)
- 🎯 **Agent Skills** (AI-native skills for knowledge workflows, research, writing)
- ⏰ **Cron configs** (ready-to-use scheduling templates)
- 🦭 **Installer Skill** (guided Socratic setup for new users)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/FairladyZ625/Obsidian-Brain-OS.git
cd Obsidian-Brain-OS
bash setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` walks you through everything interactively: vault path, user info, skills, cron, verification. Use `bash setup.sh --test` for a dry run.

### 🚀 One-Click Install (Copy-Paste to Your AI Agent)

Don't want to read docs? Just **copy the message below and send it to your AI agent** (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, OpenClaw agent, or any coding assistant). It will clone the repo, read the installer skill, and guide you through setup step by step.

```
Hi! I want to install Obsidian Brain OS — an AI-driven personal knowledge system. Please:
1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/FairladyZ625/Obsidian-Brain-OS.git
2. Read skills/brain-os-installer/SKILL.md — that's the installation guide for you
3. Follow it to set up my vault: ask me where I want it, my name, timezone, etc.
4. Run bash setup.sh with my answers (or walk me through manually)
5. After install, read docs/agents.md and help me configure my agent team
6. Help me verify everything works with the checklist at the end of setup.sh
Start now — let's get Brain OS running!

## Philosophy

> **Context is infrastructure. Knowledge is compounding.**

1. **Capture** → everything goes to INBOX first
2. **Process** → Nightly AI pipeline turns raw notes into structured knowledge
3. **Compound** → patterns emerge from cross-source synthesis
4. **Act** → daily digest + personal ops keeps you moving

The AI handles the plumbing so you can focus on signal.
